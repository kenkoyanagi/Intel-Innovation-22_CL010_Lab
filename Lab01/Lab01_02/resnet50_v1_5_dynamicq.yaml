model:                                               # mandatory. used to specify model specific information.
  name: resnet50_v1_5
  framework: onnxrt_qdq                              # mandatory. supported values are tensorflow, pytorch, pytorch_ipex, onnxrt_integer, onnxrt_qlinear or mxnet; allow new framework backend extension.

quantization:                                        # optional. tuning constraints on model-wise for advance user to reduce tuning space.
  approach: post_training_dynamic_quant               # optional. default value is post_training_static_quant.                          

evaluation:                                          # optional. required if user doesn't provide eval_func in neural_compressor.Quantization.
  accuracy:                                          # optional. required if user doesn't provide eval_func in neural_compressor.Quantization.
